## A Little Mystery…
So I started writing this post about a telephone table I wanted to give a little love and makeover. Well, upon cleaning, sanding and painting it, I noticed a thin sheet of copper on the bottom side of the interior box and holes where other copper sheets would have been nailed in.

## A Little History…

Hmmm… Very interesting. So it turns out that little tables like this were used between the 1920s and 1940s as chairside humidors to store tobacco and cigars. Tobacco and cigars, especially, needed to be stored at consistent temperatures and humidity or they would go stale. Humidors were lined with a metal sheet lining, usually cooper. That explains the one sheet that I have left on mine and the small nail holes from the missing sheets. Most designs also included built in handles so it could easily be moved within a room. Also included in many humidor tables of that era was a magazine rack where newspapers or magazines could be accessible for reading while you had your evening smoke.

## The Fun of the Find

I think this is one of those moments that make these little finds so much fun. I get a little thrill from the research and background that is discovered when you find a clue as to what your new, or rather, old find is. It’s the history teacher in me! I would have gone on thinking this was a telephone table with spaces for phone books, etc. for the rest of the life of this cutie. Now it has a little story and so do I. When friends come over and see the antiques and oddities that I have collected on display, each one has a story about what it is, and where it was acquired. There is always in my mind the great memory of the person who sold it to me and the nice conversation we had, or of the excitement of the find if it was a roadside freebie, or a Saturday yard sale buy.

All the pieces all now come together as I look at my little table. The seal on the door is awfully tight to maintain the temperature and the magazine racks on the sides with the cutouts were to put your hands through when lifting, not just decorative. I had assumed that these features were for telephone books or the like. Silly me. I will say that I appreciate all of the features of the design more now that I see there is a function to each.

## Before and After

So when it came to restoring this humidor, I wanted to do something simple, classic and eye catching. The original varnish and finish were in bad shape so sanding it down was necessary. I had sanded it to avoid making it too perfect. I also was to lazy to get the power sander from my parent’s house. I wanted a finish that was a little rough and still would show the dark black paint left from the original finish in certain places. I used an interior satin white paint for the accents and the front door and stained the rest in several layers to darken the finish. I then thought this needs something extra so I added a hand painted version of a vintage cigar label to the front door and some little details to pull it all together.

I like the pop of white bringing out the white matted picture frames. I think this table is a perfect addition to my little green room where a portion of my plants live and soak up the sun.
