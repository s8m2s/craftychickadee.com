Green thumbs or not, terrariums are something that everyone can care for. They might be the easiest to care for “garden” you may ever have. A terrarium is a tightly closed clear glass or plastic container filled with various small plants. Some people prefer the kind with an open top but I find that they require a bit more watering as moisture can escape. A closed terrarium needs very little,if any, watering after the initial amount. The amazing thing about closed terrariums is that they create their own self sustaining world of fresh air and balance/recycle the moisture within.

## First a Little History

Terrariums have a rich history that could be argued dates back to 16th century exploration. Those who were more involved in science, botany and potential philanthropic endeavors, saw value in being able to transport live plants across seas. Dried plants, roots, etc., did not travel well on long journeys and would sometimes not “take” upon arriving in their final destination due to damage already done on the journey. It was not until the 19th century in England did the idea of the terrarium as we know it develop. A physician named Dr. Nathanial Ward almost stumbled upon the idea when he saw that a fern and some grasses were growing in an enclosed glass used for studying caterpillars. He left those young plants uninterrupted for four years. They flourished without the addition of any water. It was then that the Wardian Case was born and, a soon to be, staple of decor in many Victorian homes.He had them custom built as nothing like them existed at the time. They were ornate and stood atop large bases. Ward displayed one of his cases at the Great Expedition of 1851; it had not been watered for 18 years.

In a time in Great Britain where the smog and polluted air resulting from the Industrial Revolution made it difficult for the small plants like ferns to thrive, the Wardian case was the answer. Collecting ferns and displaying other exotic plants in the home was a popular activity for the prosperous women of the Victorian Age. During this time global trade and exchange was at its peak and access to more exotic plants was made possible. A problem of the times was that many exotic plant species could not survive the very long and salty voyages to Great Britain from parts of the Near East and Africa. The Wardian case changed international trade forever. Fresh water along the journey was not needed for the plants being transported, which was good, because there was none in some cases. Wardian cases were used for transporting exotic plants from their native lands to other locations within the British Empire. Teas from Shanghai, China were smuggled to India, the “jewel in the crown” of the British Empire, increasing profits for them as well as solidifying India as a central locale for tea, because we know the Brits love their tea. This was also done for transporting rubber plants from Brazil to Ceylon (Sri Lanka today). It was here that Great Britain was able to get in on two of the most profitable agricultural goods of the time. One could argue that the wealth and power of the British Empire could not have happened on the scale that it did without Dr. Ward. A tropical plant craze occurred all throughout the British Empire and elsewhere, influencing home decor, paintings and of course the terrarium. Today styles have simplified quite a bit but the inner workings and build of terrariums have not changed all that much.

## Time to get your hands dirty

So how do you create one of your very own you ask? Well, boy, did you come to the right place! Here is a step by step guide as well as some links to where to get accessories, containers, and great plants that will thrive with little care.

  1. First choose a container. This can be something as simple as a Ball or Mason jar, a glass jar from your recycling bin, glass cookie jars, or apothecary glass. Bell jars with a base or a cloche also work well. You may also use small glass showcases, or glass paned cases. Use your imagination.
  2. The supplies you will need are easy to get, you may have some already. Your local garden shop should have them if you don’t. You can also use those flattened glass stones used in fish tanks. They come in many cool colors. Be creative. 
    * Potting soil
    * Charcoal flakes
    * Small pebbles (enough to create a 1″ layer on the bottom of your container for drainage)
  3. While you are in your local garden shop, take a look at their selection of small houseplants. They will usually be displayed indoors and can be purchased as small plants maybe 1–3″ tall. If you are not sure which to get don’t be afraid to ask for help. My suggestion is to go for maybe 2–3 plants depending on the size of the container. Ferns, African violets, strawberry begonias, nerve plant and moon valley are a few moisture loving smaller plants that should thrive. You can also get more from these plants as they grow, you can take clippings, shoots and rootings from them for your other terrariums. You can’t have just one!
  4. You’ll also need a spray bottle, for cleaning your plants once you are done, a bowl for your soil and newspaper to put under all of your work. Staying clean always makes a project easier. You won’t have negative after thoughts of the project being a mess. Just think ahead of how to make things easier for yourself!
  5. Once you have all your ingredients, it’s time to start making your terrarium. A terrarium or any planter for that matter needs good drainage so roots don’t rot. Layer the small pebbles about 1″ deep on the bottom of your container. If you are making a super small one, you can use fewer pebbles. Also make sure they are clean if they are from outside as they will be showing. I like to use polished pebbles used for fish tanks.
  6. The next layer is the charcoal. This acts as a filter to keep your terrarium clean. You can just pour it in. Use just enough to cover the pebbles so you can’t see them from the top. Don’t worry about the glass getting dirty, you will clean it later. Try to keep yourself clean. I always get flashbacks of loading toner into the copy machine at my old job. It was always the day I wore white. Oops.
  7. Next layer is the soil- put some of your potting soil in the bowl. You can always add more so start small. Add some charcoal flakes mixed in if you like. You will want to add enough water to the soil to make it moist. I don’t like to plant new plants in dry dirt. It will also help you when you water at the end-it will need less later. When watering dry soil the water usually goes right through. Pre-watering now will prevent that.
  8. Now place some of your plants in. Before you commit to putting them in, just place them in and see how it looks. You may want a taller one in the middle as a focal point, or you want to save room for a great rock. This is the fun part. Once you settle on a plan, you can add a little more soil around the plants to secure them in. You can add some more pebbles or any other accessories like toadstools, rocks, pinecones etc.
  9. Clean it all. Use the spray bottle on the setting where it shoots out the water in a stream not a mist, and clean off your plants or any of the pebbles etc. that have soil on them. This should be enough water for your terrarium for a long long time. You can use a paper towelto dry the inside wall and any last minute touches. Put the lid on and Voila! You are done.
  10. Place your terrarium where it can get indirect light and enjoy. For the first month or so monitor the moisture levels. I take the lid off if there is too much condensation inside and put it back on after 15 minutes. You may need to do this a few times or maybe not at all. If your plants are getting full you can always remove or trim them as well. They will be pretty happy in there.
