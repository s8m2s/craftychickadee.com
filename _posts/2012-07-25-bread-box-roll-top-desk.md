## The Find
A few weekends ago I discovered at a yard sale the most adorable pale pink Kreamer Bread Box. I chatted briefly with the woman who had used it in her kitchen for probably 60 or more years. She was helping me brainstorm what colors to repaint my $3.00 purchase. As I hopped to the car,excited for my new project, I thought, hey, I kind of like the original pink. It was in such good condition that it really didn’t need much work. It even has an adorable Bakelite knob. It’s a cute pink, like the color or Smarties, one of my favorite candies when I was little.

## A Little Background

So it sat in my office while I mulled over some ideas. There is no room for it in my kitchen on the counter, the most obvious place for it. Bread boxes were very popular in kitchens in the 19th century and continued into the 20th and 21st as well. They would store a whole loaf of bread and keep it as fresh as possible. And who doesn’t love bread that has not been squished and flattened. I grew up in a house with everything being stored in the freezer, so I can appreciate the sentiment. In a time when bread was baked at home and their really was not an alternative made commercially and full of preservatives, bread boxes were very handy. Believe it or not, bread does not get stale by drying out, but actually from getting cold. Storing it in the refrigerator is actually worse. Bread boxes stored bread at room temperature so they stayed fresh longer and kept little critters out.They look cute too.

Modern bread boxes are not too different in their style than their counterparts from the 1950s. They are usually a roll top, while some earlier ones are literally a wooden box.They can be hard to find without rust or dents, so being able to keep the original color is great. I am a fan of those kitschy ones from the 1950s and 60s. It’s the cute colors I think. I’m a sucker for mint green and chrome.

## What To Do With It?

But then it dawned on me- a roll top for the desk in my office. Roll tops are a great hideaway for the unsightly and a catch all for loose ends. I instantly neatened up my desk and freed up more space. I had so many ideas running through my head for alternative uses but since I tend to clutter things on my desk, this was the best idea for me. Something different may work for you.

Store your sewing thread, crafts supplies, jewelry,spices, snacks in the kitchen, or bread of course.If you ever see one of these cuties, don’t count it out just because it doesn’t match your kitchen or you don’t have a use for it at the time. Think a little. Things can be repainted or repurposed. There really are a lot of uses for things if you just think out of the box. Pun intended.
