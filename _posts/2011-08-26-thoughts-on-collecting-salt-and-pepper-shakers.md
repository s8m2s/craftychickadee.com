Hmmm…. Is it a conscious decision to collect things or is it something we don’t even know we are doing? Maybe at first it’s a subtle action that no one even notices; a couple of things you buy here and there. But before you know it you are hiding them when you bring them in the house and are afraid the rule of “bring something in, take something out of the house” being enacted by those you live with. That is a scary scenario. So when is too much too much? I guess when you are running out of space, or when you show someone your collection and they go ” ooooh, wow! you have a lot!”( but they are really planning their escape and hoping you don’t have people buried in the basement) instead of genuinely commenting on how awesome the collection is. Is it only a collection a mother could love, or are their others with similar interests and collections? Well I have recently started getting interested in salt and pepper shakers. At least they are small. “Some people collect motorcycles,” I tell my husband. Can I consciously decide to just like them a lot from afar or will it progress to a physical collection? I guess we’ll see…I’ll keep you posted.

### Ohh and check these out if you have given into collecting…
