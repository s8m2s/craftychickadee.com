I finally got the photos of my husbandâ€™s iPad man bag! This was a custom made piece that I made with materials and fabric that we had in the house. It is lined with micro fiber fabric and includes 2 inner pockets with sections for phone, pens etc. So far I think it has held up well. It is a simple design which makes it easy to reproduce but functional and one of a kind!
