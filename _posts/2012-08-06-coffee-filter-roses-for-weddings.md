## Wedding Lifesaver
Wedding season is well under way, so I wanted to share my life saving wedding craft that I used two years ago in my own wedding. I am not fully sold on the need for cut flowers at weddings, and prefer the live option. I know there may be quite a difference between the quality and cost, but I have always preferred live plants. I did use potted plants for my favor and centerpieces but opted for handmade for the bouquets. I also wanted to save a boat load of money. Once again necessity is the mother of all invention. Not my invention, but rather, a well researched and borrowed one. I decided to handmake my flowers out of coffee filters. You may have seen these while browsing the Internet or maybe on Etsy. They are slowly making their way into weddings as an affordable, more time consuming option that the florist.

## Pros

The great thing about these flowers is that you can start well in advance with making the flowers and even recruit friends to help. They are fairly easy to make but require some patience. The amount that you can save and the awesomeness of the finished product are well worth it. They don’t wilt, are customizable and they photograph well. In fact, I was speaking with a friend, who also was our wedding photographer, and he just realized that they were not real flowers. He was a bit shocked. Craft success!

I am not going to give you all a step by step tutorial, as Martha Stewart’s got that covered. I stumbled upon her site’s video as well as others and studied them and built up the courage to try them. They supplies needed are not costly so failure was not the end of the world. Well, they were such a hit that I have taught other friends and helped them save thousands on their wedding budget.

Included below this post are my favorite links for the supplies needed and tutorial videos. You can be very creative in how you accent your roses. I used sola wood flowers in a similar ivory and peach tone. These additional flowers, etc. can also be filler so less flowers are needed. If you have any questions or comments let me know below. Happy crafting!
