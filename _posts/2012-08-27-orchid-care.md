## Orchid Care Myths Debunked
After writing an earlier post on terrariums I renewed my love for orchids and have picked up a few to try my luck. They were a very popular plant in the Victorian Age, and just one of the many exotic plants that many women were caring for in their Wardian Cases. I like to think that I have a green thumb( just don’t judge me by my lawn) and I am sure that I can be confident in my green thumbness if I can master the orchid. They have a bad rap as a difficult to care for plant, but in all of the research I have done, I am costantly told that they are one of the easiest. What these lovelies need from people to stay alive is actually very simple.

## Native Environment Plays a Part

When looking at what any plant needs, I like to think about where they natively grow. If you can replicate the conditions of their native enviroment then caring for any plant shouldn’t be so hard. There are over 20,000 orchid species, so I am not going to be able to look at each location but will tell you all a little about some of the most popular orchids. Orchids gained their popularity in the 1800s with the increases presence of Europeans in many exotic locations during the age of imperialism. They brought back many plants with them and since then over 100,000 types of orchid hybrids have been produced. Wow. Orchids can be found growing worldwide but are in the largest numbers in Asia, South America and Central America. The climate is warm and very humid in those places. Years ago when I had vacationed in Thailand, I saw so many beautiful orchids growing in nurseries and can attest to the high humidity in Thailand. Its really really humid. Certain regions have more consistent rain than others and that has effected the development of orchid species.They grow on the branches of trees with their roots exposed. Orchids are interesting because their roots can actually go through photosynthesis so they actually like getting light. Some orchids actually can grow in hanging baskets with just some moss.

## Most Popular Orchid Species

The most popular orchid variety is the Phalaenopsis or Moth Orchid. This species gives off the most long lasting blooms and the some of the largest flowers. The blooms can last over three months. You can find these and other species in nurseried but also in supermarkets in the summer. They probably don’t last that long in the supermarkets so do them and favor and take them home! Phalaenopsis orchids like consistent moisture as they do not have a pseudobulb, like a camel has humps, to store water in case of a draught. Orchids do not grow in soil like other plants, because they grow on tree trunks. Orchids therefore like bark, and moss, both of which are on trees in humid tropical environments. So a special orchid mix can be used. Give the Phalaenopsis a good watering once a week, letting the excess run out, and plenty of sun, but not direct sunlight. Your Phalaenopsis should bloom in the summer and in winter.

Oncidium, Epidendrum, Miltonia, Dendrobium,Cymbidium, Cattleyas have pseudobulbs from which the stems grow. Each pseudobulb blooms just once (orchids continualy send out more pseudobulbs) and are a species of orchids that developed in regions that are tropical but can have draught periods. They adapted very well and created over many generations a way to store water. That does not mean that you don’t have to water them. They are not a cactus. These types actually like a good watering once a week, letting the excess water run out the bottom. These orchids are best planted in a loose bark as they do not need to be surrounded in moss around the roots. They will fine in moss, but certain species prefer more air around their roots ans moss can be packed too tightly. If your orchid came potted in moss, thats fine, you can repot it every year and use a more barklike orchid mix next time. You may even use a mix of moss and bark. Orchids of these species like to be pot bound wich means they like being in a small pot. Do not think they are being squished, they like it. You can go up a pot size if they seem to be growing out of their pot every year to eighteen months. They also prefer indirect sun.

## What Every Orchid Wants

Every orchid wants humidity, air circulation and indirect sunlight. To spoil your mist it i the morning with water, or put the pot on top of a pebble tray with water. Basically you just take a small dish and fill it with pebbles and enough water to almost cover them all. Place the orchid pot on top of the pebbles, making sure that roots are not in the water. Your orchids will love the humidity from the evaporating water. Refill the water as it evaporates. Orchids also love air circulation. Place your orchid in a room with light and avoid them getting sun directly and you’re golden. If you really want to spoil them you can give them orchid food once a month according to the directions on the package.

What really sets orchids apart, besides their unusual flowers,is their potting medium. Other than that they like what most plants that we don’t think are difficult want. Most houseplants that people have are from tropical environments and want humidity, a good soak once a week and indirect sun. Orchids aren’t too different. Bad rap debunked! For the little effort that is needed, the reward is pretty cool.
