## Cheap Crafts Are The Best Crafts
Everyone has T shirts, old or new that they can use to make some cute projects. I have been seeing a lot about T Shirt scarves but today I made a T Shirt wreath for my front door. I have been hanging the same spring decoration all summer and needed to change it up as its no longer spring but that transition from summer to autumn. I also had T shirts on the brain as I was putting away laundry and cleaning out my closet a bit. This is a craft that anyone can do and can be adapted in numerous ways.

## How To

All you need is a few old cotton T shirts, a scissor and a needle and thread. I used three different old shirts so that the braid would have a changes in color but do what you would like. Next step is to cut, starting from the bottom, one continuous 1-2 inch wide strip of fabric. you will find yourself cutting around and around your shirt until the arm holes where you can then stop. So this for all of the shirts. Some of the pieces were a bit long and made braiding a little tangle some so cut where you need to so that braiding is easier and tie back on the pieces when you need more. The knots where you attach more fabric pieces doe not show once you sew. When you have a braid long enough to make the wreath size you would like, get your needle and thread. Lay the braid flat on a table make your circle. Sew the the braids together along the backside to connect them into a cute wreath. To make the wreath hang a bit tighter I used shortened bamboo skewers woven through the braids on the backside. They made the wreath better able to keep its shape when having. You could use popsicle stick instead.
