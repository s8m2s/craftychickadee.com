When on a tight budget, I find that around the holidays and special occasions, most gifts are handmade. It’s a great way to save a bit, make something special that a lot of time and love has gone into, and to try new ideas. Sometimes it can even be a project that can inspire others too .It’s my way to relax and unwind even when the sewing machine is giving me a hard time and schnerping, as my mom calls it ( when the bobbin thread bunches). I still find enjoyment in the projects that I create for myself. My latest project was a gift for my sister for her birthday. I wanted to make her a clutch handbag to use when she goes out for drinks with friends. I used the fabrics that I had around the house and its was actually a lot of fun to literally piece together the various finds of my basement sewing room. I lined the inside with a simple cotton but included a magnetic snap closure and small inner pocket for little items. The last touch was a vintage brass lamp chain as a handle. I loved it so much I can’t wait to make one for myself. Love those cute little chickadees!!!!
