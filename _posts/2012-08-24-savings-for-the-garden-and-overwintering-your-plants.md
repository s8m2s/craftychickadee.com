## Keeping Up With the Jones’

Have you ever looked around during the spring and summer months at all of those beautiful homes and gardens in your neighborhood and wondered how much did they spend on it all? Well, there are ways to get that garden look you want, or that patio full of beautiful plants without spending too much year after year. There are a large number of plants that can be reused yearly and great ideas for small apartment or patio gardens that won’t cost too much if you just think a little creatively.

## Container Gardens

If you don’t have the soil quality or sun that you want in your yard, or have a tiny space to grow plants and veggies, container gardening is a great option. Container gardening uses a large planter or pot to grow multiple types of plants that hopefully need the same conditions of sun and watering. Your container garden could be a strawberry pot full of climbing plants,an herb garden or whatever you think of. Sometimes large flower pots can be a bit pricey and heavy but there are alternate options for your container. You might even have some in your home now. Waste paper baskets make cheap containers, especially if you are shopping at Ikea. Broken or old teapots are cute for your herbs and flowers and excess water can be poured out from the spout. I have used coffee mugs, tea cups, ice buckets, ladels, measuring cups, mason jars, recyclable jars, galvanized steel buckets, even an old galvanized steel mop bucket, and a vintage enamel colander. Anything that can hold the soil and is that appropriate size for want you are growing. Just make sure to put some pebbles, rocks, broken pottery, or styrofoam peanuts in the bottom to provide drainage and avoid roots rotting if there is no hole in your container. You can also drill a hole in the bottom of a container if you’re into power tools. Your container gardens can be moved indoors or kept out and adjusted easily for sun and shade needs. You can group them together to make a beautiful collection.

## How To Save From Year To Year

Every year I try to buy perennials that will return next year so that I don’t waste money on annuals that will die. I have found this could solve all of my issues with trying to save money on my garden, but perennials are a bit more money than annuals which die annually. I try to only purchase those perennials that will spread the next year or that can be split into more plants to get more bang for my buck, like hostas, clematis, daisys or bellflowers. I am a sucker for pretty flowers and the annuals just grab my attention sometimes with their big tropical blooms and brightly colored leaves and I suck it up and buy them. However,if you shop carefully for annuals you can find ones that are cheaper, especially if you start from seeds, and can be reused next spring if you take a few extra steps before the frost comes in autumn.&nbsp_place_holder;

## Three Methods for Saving Your Plants

There are a few ways to save those beautiful annuals that are going to kick it the second it starts to get chilly at night. Most annuals are used to more tropical climates or warmer zones of the U.S. Overwintering them means caring for your plants indoors when the outdoor climate is no longer inappropriate. Some even need a cold spell to reflower again next year but not so cold that they die. Overwintering tries to create the conditions that they are accustomed to in their native environment but indoors.&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;

## Method 1.Take Cuttings

Taking cuttings from what you have outside before it gets chilly.This is a simple way to get more plants from the original “mother plant. You can put these cuttings in water or right into potting soil and let them have plenty of sun. There might be some that don’t make it but most will be just fine. You can leave the rooted cuttings in a clear glass container in a sunny window, but only let the bottom of the stem sit in the water not the leaves. This method works well for plants that have softer watery stems that are not hard or are vines. The most common are begonias, coleus and geraniums, and they work well with his method. You can also use this method over the spring/summer when you want more plants from the ones you have growing outside. You’ll have a bunch of happy and healthy plants that have gotten a nice head start indoors when spring rolls around.

## Method 2.The Houseplant Plan

Another method that works well is taking your tropical plants and other annuals indoors and replicating the conditions that they would have natively. This means taking them indoors and basically treating them like houseplants. Let them have a bit of a transition into your indoor conditions and don’t be afraid if leaves fall off, they should return. I&nbsp_place_holder;have two wonderful mandevilla plants that I am going to overwinter indoors this fall and winter with this method. Most plants that prefer this method like temps above 50 degrees Fahrenheit and sun. If you have a sunny spot in a room with heat give it a try. If your plants likes humidity you can try putting a humidifier on or putting your plants on a tray filled with a layer of pebbles and water. Be sure that the plants don’t sit in the water, but rather sit on the pebbles. The water will evaporate and surround your plants with a slight humidity. They will love you for it. Plants that love this method are also begonias, and geraniums (you can try both methods with these to have even more plants in spring) bougainvillea, hibiscus, mandevilla, jasmine and similar tropicals.&nbsp_place_holder;

## Method 3.Dormancy

This method again involves giving your plants a little feel of their native conditions. Some annual plants need a cold or dormant period to produce flowers again. For these plants they should be allowed to dry out and be in a cold dark place like a dry basement, garage, or cellar. Winter blooming cyclamen also like this but in the opposite time- the summer. All you have to do is take your plants indoors, you can even leave them in the pots if you want. Do make sure they are dry before you do this, so ease up on the watering a week or two before frost comes. Some people swear by taking the bulbs out of their pots and putting the dry bulbs in paper bags in a cold dark place. This all depends on the effort you want to put in. I think leaving it in the pot is fine as long as its dry. Figs prefer this method. They need to be in a dark but not freezing location for the winter. Caladium, banana plant also like this dormant period. Remember to transition them slowly back into the sunlight when spring comes.&nbsp_place_holder;

So give these methods a try with your plants. You have nothing to lose if you were intending on letting them die anyway. You’ll be surprised how much you’ll save next year and how big your plants will be next spring and summer. Do a bit of searching to find out which method your plant likes best. There are some great links below for how to identify your plants. When in doubt send me a comment and a photo and we can identify it.&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;&nbsp_place_holder;
