## A Penny Saved
Many people hear the word economical and think its about buying from the sale rack or more visits to mom and dad’s house for dinner. I think it’s a whole different way of thinking about what you have and what you can do to not waste it. There are so many phrases that we hear like “time is money” and “waste not want not,” that we are supposed to follow. But being economical is a whole way of life for some who reuse what they can and take care of what they have because the expense to replace things can not be afforded. There is a new generation of people who are living this way, myself included, with the recession we are currently pulling ourselves out of. I actually think it is good for people to learn how to fix something broken, how to alternatively use what is available and save money in the process. We are becoming DIYers out of necessity and more handy in the process.

## Frugality Way Back When

In an economical spirit I often find myself re reading an old book titled The American Frugal Housewife by Lydia Maria Francis Child in 1832. My love of history and curiosity of learning how people lived in this time from the perspective of how to run a household, keeps me peaking back in the chapters of this book. As a new homeowner who is trying to save here and there, there is timeless advice from Ms. Child, and, some that are more outdated as new technology and discoveries are made. Specifically, the use of quicksilver (mercury) to rid your house of bed bugs or lead use, is advice I maybe would not take. There are quite a few household remedies that involve ingredients that are now known to be hazardous, not sold in regular shops or, in some cases it is unknown what the heck they are. I find I am the most curious about these. Half the fun of this book is looking into the common names that were used for certain remedies to find out what they actually are in scientific terms or modern words.There are so many pearls of wisdom that correlate with those that are still passed down with interest to the economical ladies and gents of today. Either way it’s a fun read even if you skip around and get just a few ideas from Ms. Child.

## Great Advice Through the Ages

The American Frugal Housewife is a book written by a woman who we actually all know. She is an accomplished author who had to live on a modest budget when she was first married in her twenties. She is probably writing for us advice she follows herself and/or was passed down to her through her mother on how to economically run a household and raise a family. She appears to live a modest life without the use of maids or domestics but rather is of the mindset of doing things yourself if you can. Remember there was no electricity, refrigeration, pharmacy or supermarket on every corner where premade things could be bought. She was probably very busy most of her days and from the sounds of what had to be done daily, it’s a wonder that she had any spare time to even write. Most people probably know her as the author of the holiday poem “Over the River and through the woods to grandmother’s house we go…” but she also became a well known women’s rights activist and abolitionist in her day.

## Here are some timeless tidbits of advice

Below is some of Ms. Child’s advice to settle your mind and a few household remedies that are still good today if you want to give them a try. There are of course many many more in her book.

“The true economy of housekeeping is simply the art of gathering up all the fragments so that nothing be lost. I mean fragments of time,as well as materials. Nothing should be thrown aways as long as it is possible to make us of it, however trifling it may be, and whatever be the size if the family, every member should be employed in either earning or saving money.”

“Begin early is the great maxim for everything in education. A child of six years old can be made useful; and should be taught to consider everyday lost in which something has not been done to assist others.”

“If you are about to furnish a house, do not spend all your money, be it much or little. Do not let the beauty of this thing, and the cheapness of that, tempt you to buy unnecessary articles…nothing is cheap that we do not want.”

“…let them prove, by exertion of ingenuity and economy, that neatness, good taste, and gentility, are attainable without great expense.”

“Teach children to share everything with their playmates, but never allow them to destroy anything.”

” It is the character of good economy to be as comfortable and genteel with a little, as others can be with much.”

“The man who is economical,is laying up for himself the permanent power of being useful and generous.”

” A warming pan full of coals, or a shovel of coals, held over varnished furniture, will take out white spots. Care should be taken to not hold the coals near enough to scorch; and the place should be rubbed with flannel while warm.”

> A hair drier would do, as well as rubbing the spot with mayonaise!(the oil and vinegar in mayo does the trick- I’ve tried it!)

“Woolens should be washed in very hot suds, and not rinsed. Lukewarm water shrinks them”

” On the contrary, silk, or anything that has silk in it, should be washed in water almost cold. Hot water turns it yellow. It may be washed in suds made of nice white soap;but no soap should be put upon it. Likewise, avoid he use of hot irons in smoothing silk.Either rub the articles dry with a soft cloth, or put them between two towels, and press them with weights.”

” The best way to cleanse gold is, to wash it in warm suds made of a delicate soap, with ten or fifteen drops of sal volatile ( ammonia) in it. This makes jewels very brilliant.”

I often find I am thoroughly entertained by the oddities, stark contrasts to today in terms of conveniences, and the recipes, but am also humbled by her advice of being economical. She puts it all in perspective that we should be fortunate for what we have. The happiest people don’t have the best of everything, they make the best of everything.
